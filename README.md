# Tetris

#Working on version of Tetris game written in Object Oriented C++. Following the project of Javier Lopez.

#The structure of the project is object oriented. There exist the following classes:

#Pieces --> it contains the pieces and some methods to access them; there are 7 pieces (square, I, L, L mirrored, N, N mirrored, T) in their 4 possible rotations; each piece is stored in a 5x5 matrix. other matrices contain for each piece in each rotated position the initial displacement to center the piece into the screen

#Board --> here we have the board and all the methods to initialize it, to access it,  to store pieces and some other control functions.

#Game -->
